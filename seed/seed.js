Break in the egg and mix well with your hands. When everything is well combined, break off walnut-size pieces and roll into balls – you should end up with about 28. The mixture will be very soft.\n\nHeat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan then gently fry the meatballs in two batches until firm and pale golden, turning them every now and then so they brown evenly. Each batch should take 6-8 mins.\n\nWipe out the pan to remove excess fat and add the remaining garlic and thyme, then pour in the bouillon and bring to the boil. Turn off the heat, stir in the crème fraîche and remaining dill, then return the meatballs to the pan and turn them in the mixture until coated.\n\nFor the salad, mix the apple, onion, parsley and capers with the lemon, then stir through the beetroot. Serve the salad alongside the meatballs. If you’re cooking for two people, eat half the meatballs and salad now, and chill the rest for another day – it will keep in the fridge for up to three days. Reheat the meatballs in the microwave until piping hot.',
